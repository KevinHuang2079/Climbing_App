        Issue: getReplies
        - issue when clicking on the button that opens replies for a comment (passes in commentID)
        - It duplicates the one reply that a comment had 

        Reason: appends replies without checking if they've already been added
        setDisplayedReplies(prev => ({
            ...prev, 
            [commentID]: [ ...(prev[commentID] || []), ...replies] //spreads the replies at commentID into new state and tacks on the replies
        }));

        solution: getReplies
        checks if 
        setDisplayedReplies(prev => ({
            ...prev, 
            [commentID]: [
                ...(prev[commentID] || []), 
                ...replies.filter(newReply => !(prev[commentID] || []).some(reply => reply._id === newReply._id)) // Prevent duplicates
            ]
        }));

        - HOW THIS SHIT WORKS: replies.filter(newReply => !(prev[commentID] || []).some(reply => reply._id === newReply._id)) // Prevent duplicates
        - .some checks if newReply is a duplicate (through an id comparison) returns true if there is an element that follows this criteria (=== to some element in replies old state)
        - negating means that it will return false if it's a duplicate (and filter includes only elements that FOLLOW the criteria, meaning this duplicate will not be included in the new state)
